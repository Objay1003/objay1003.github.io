      <h1>My story</h1>
      <p>I began road biking during my sophomore year at Gunn. I was dealing with various issues throughout my life and stress from my classes, so I began embarking on lengthy bike rides into the Los Altos Hills near my home. I had also recently received a brand new road bike in compensation for a car accident and thought to put it to good use. These bike rides allowed me to briefly forget the problems throughout my life and enjoy nature at its best. The thrill of cruising down steep hills reaching speeds of nearly 40 mph created an unresistable urge every weekend. As my sophomore year progressed, a friend of mine invited me to train with him and his friend's dad, both of them serious road bikers. Their training routes were much longer than any of my previous bike rides. Unsurprisingly, I was quite nervous of tiring out and embarassing myself out in front of them. However, when the moment came, it did not seem so tiring. It felt rather relaxing, contrary to my expectations. I felt as if I had finally found my true passion. I began training weekly with my friends and soon, not only discovered my true passion, but developed a strong bond within our group which allowed me to approach my physical limits during our bike rides and created a feeling of brotherhood which, even as we grow older and drift apart, I will never forget.</p>
      <p>My bike is a 2018 Scott Speedster 30.</p>
