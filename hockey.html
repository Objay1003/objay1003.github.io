      <p>My hockey team, the San Jose Jr. Sharks AAA, qualified for the California State Championships and was invited to participate in the Bauer World Invitational in Chicago. The previous year, I was a member of the California Cougars, where I led our team to third at the California State Championships, and was voted Most Valuable Player.</p>
