      <h1>Hi I'm Ronnie!</h1>
      <p>I am a sophomore at Henry M. Gunn High School as of May 14, 2019. I like math and chemistry.</p>
      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>Some of my hobbies unrelated to academics are ice hockey, running, swimming, road biking, and photography.</p>
      <p>At school, I am a part of the Gunn Parliamentary Debate team, the varsity track and field team, and a member of United Computations, Science Olympiad, Physics club, and Math Circle.</p>
      <p>Some of my road biking accomplishments are: Montebello (5.3 mi, 3000ft), Old La Honda (29.5 min), Ca√±ada &rightarrow; Stevens Canyon (100km). The top speed I have reached is 42.8 mph on Hawk Hill. My bike is a 2018 Scott Speedster 30.</p>
      <p>My hockey team, the San Jose Jr. Sharks AAA, qualified for the California State Championships and was invited to participate in the Bauer World Invitational in Chicago. The previous year, I was a member of the California Cougars, where I led our team to third at the California State Championships, and was voted Most Valuable Player.</p>
      <p>I swam with the Palo Alto Swim Association, training with the SCRA division. I qualified for Junior National Championships in 2013 and 2014 during the short course season, while qualifying for Far Western Championships in 2013.</p>
