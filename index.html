<h1>Hi I'm Ronnie!</h1>
<p class="fourteen-point">I am a sophomore at Henry M. Gunn High School as of May 14, 2019. I like math and chemistry. <br> Some of my hobbies are ice hockey, running, swimming, road biking, and photography. <br> At school, I am apart of the Gunn Parliamentary Debate team, the varsity track and field team, and a member of United Computations, Science Olympiad, Physics club, and Math Circle <br> Some of my road biking accomplishments are: Montebello(5.3 mi, 3000ft), Old La Honda(29.5 min), CaÃ±ada -> Stevens Canyon(100km). The top speed I have reached is 42.8 mph on Hawk Hill. My bike is a 2018 Scott Speedster 30. <br> My hockey team, the San Jose Jr. Sharks AAA, qualified for Nationals this previous season, while winning the California State Championships. The previous year, I was a member of the California Cougars, where I lead our team to third at the California State Championships, and was voted Most Valuable Player.</p>
